# Ingress Block

This project is an example block with no operations.

## Manifest

The `kblock.yaml` file defines the block manifest. This is where you can find the block definitions
such as names, icons and description as well as optional operator environment settings.

## Inputs

The file `src/values.schema.json` is where the input JSON schema of the block is defined.

## Implementation

The engine is set to `noop` so no operations are performed.

## Outputs
