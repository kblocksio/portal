    "description": "Environments are a critical aspect of software development and deployment. They represent isolated spaces where developers can build, test, and deploy their applications without interference. Environments can range from local development environments to fully-fledged production setups, each tailored to meet the specific needs of different stages in the software lifecycle. Managing environments helps platform teams ensure consistency, security, and scalability, providing developers with a reliable space to experiment and deliver their code. This category offers a variety of tools to configure and manage these environments efficiently, ensuring smoother workflows and minimizing potential disruptions across teams.",

    "title": "CI/CD",
    "description": "Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a set of practices that enable rapid and reliable software development by automating the integration of code changes and their delivery to production environments. With CI/CD, developers can commit code more frequently, ensuring that new features and bug fixes are integrated seamlessly into the main branch without breaking the build. This reduces manual intervention, speeds up the release cycle, and ensures consistent quality across deployments. The CI/CD building blocks provided in this category allow platform teams to create automated pipelines that enhance developer productivity while maintaining code quality and system stability.",
