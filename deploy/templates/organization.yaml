  # Welcome to Kblocks Portal

  The Kblocks Portal is a web application that allows you to discover and manage blocks in your
  clusters.

  To learn more about how to create and install blocks to your cluster, go to https://kblocks.io/docs.

  ## Using the Portal

  The [Catalog](/catalog) section shows all available block types that can be deployed in your clusters:
  - Browse through different categories of blocks
  - View detailed documentation for each block type
  - See example configurations and usage patterns
  - Search for specific block types using the search bar

  ### Creating New Resources

  To create new resources in your clusters:

  1. Navigate to the [Resources](/resources) section
  2. Click the "Create Resource" button
  3. Select the block type you want to create
  4. Fill in the configuration form
  5. Choose the target cluster
  6. Click Create to deploy the resource

  ### Organizing Resources with Projects

  [Projects](/projects) help you organize and group related resources:
  - Create projects to logically group resources together
  - Add resources to projects during or after creation
  - View all resources within a project in one place
